neoan3 is all that and more. 

[See documentation](http://neoan3.rocks/getting-started/) (work in progress)

## Installation

_via cli_

1. Run `neoan3 new app [base]`
2. Run `composer install` (only when prompted; should run automatically)

# What is neoan3?

Neoan3 is a complete rewrite of [neoanPHP](https://github.com/sroehrl/neoanPHP) and modernizes the approach greatly.
This version is in its infancy and not intended for production-projects yet.

However, I enjoy comments, contributions & critique.
