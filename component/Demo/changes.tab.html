    <h2 class="text-primary">Not your first neoan3 project? We've got some news.</h2>
    <p>
        3.1.x embraces PHP8 further more with making use of Attributes! (Don't worry, neoan3 is still fully compatible down to 7.4)
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-lg text-primary">What's new?</h2>
    <h3 class="font-md text-primary">Events</h3>
    <p class="m-t-3 font-md">
        Events have a new static method called "hook".
        This enables you to listen to hooks even after they have been fired programmatically and when running PHP single-threaded.
        This doesn't mean you can go back in time, but it allows reacting based on past events.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-md text-primary">Attributes & Providers</h3>
    <p class="m-t-3 font-md">
        The biggest change is the introduction of a ReflectionWrapper in the core, allowing to read Attributes and react on them based on
        loaded providers. See the Demo-Frame constructor for an example on how to pass in your providers to attributes.
        Your business logic will be easier on the eye and written independently from worrying about dependency injection and testability.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-md text-primary">Migration</h3>
    <p class="m-t-3 font-md">
        With improvements on the CLI, easier index-handling is possible for the UI.
